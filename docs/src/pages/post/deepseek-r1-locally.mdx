## Step 3: Configure Model Settings
When configuring your model, you'll encounter quantization options:

<Callout type="tip">
Quantization balances performance and resource usage:
- **Q4:** Recommended for most users - optimal balance of efficiency and quality
- **Q8:** Higher precision but requires more computational resources
</Callout>

## Step 4: Configure Prompt Template
Final configuration step:

1. Access Model Settings via the sidebar
2. Locate the Prompt Template configuration
3. Use this specific format:

<Callout type="warning">
